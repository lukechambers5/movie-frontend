## Authentication

- Users sign in with email/password using the backend `/auth` endpoints.
- **JWT tokens** are stored in `Secure`, `HttpOnly` cookies set by the backend.
- On page load, the frontend sends a request to `/auth/check` to validate login status.
- Auth state is maintained across routes, but not across refreshes unless the cookie is still valid.
